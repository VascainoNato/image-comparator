# Image Comparator

This project provides a practical comparison of popular image formats — PNG, JPG, WebP, and AVIF — focusing on file size and quality differences. It includes scripts and a simple web interface to convert images and measure their sizes, helping developers and designers make informed decisions about image optimization.

## Features

- Convert images between PNG, JPG, WebP, and AVIF formats using `convert.js`.
- Measure and log file sizes with `fileSize.js`.
- Simple `index.html` interface to visualize and interact with the images.
- Generate detailed reports and graphs to compare compression efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running the conversion and file size scripts)
- A modern browser to open `index.html`

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-comparator.git
   cd image-comparator

2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Usage
- Use convert.js to convert images to different formats.
- Use fileSize.js to log and compare file sizes.
- Open index.html in a browser to view and interact with the images and results.
